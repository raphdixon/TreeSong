Here’s an explicit spec and Replit/Dev prompt that will move your UI from “approximate Win95” to actual pixel-perfect Win95—in line with your reference image. Your current UI is headed in the right direction (bevelled, no rounding), but falls over on iconography, font, palette, and layout discipline.

⸻

SPEC: Turn your app into a true Windows 95 audio player

1. Fonts:
	•	Use a bitmap font:
	•	Chicago, MS Sans Serif, or Perfect DOS VGA 437
	•	Google Fonts: Press Start 2P is a decent web fallback.
	•	Apply this everywhere. No anti-aliasing.

font-family: 'Press Start 2P', 'MS Sans Serif', monospace;
image-rendering: pixelated;
font-size: 12px;



⸻

2. Icons and Emojis:
	•	Swap ALL modern emojis for 16×16 or 20×20 pixel art icons.
	•	Use free Win95/98 icon packs (iconarchive) or make your own pixel emoji.
	•	Reaction grid = only pixel icons, not Apple/Google style emoji.

⸻

3. Colours:
	•	Strictly use the Win95 16-colour palette:
	•	Title bar: #000080 (navy blue)
	•	Button face: #C0C0C0 (light grey)
	•	Button shadow: #808080 (dark grey)
	•	Button highlight: #FFFFFF (white)
	•	Text: #000000
	•	Parent background: grey, not teal (#C0C0C0). If you must use a pattern, use a subtle checker.
	•	No drop shadows, no gradients.

⸻

4. Structure & Layout:
	•	Title bar: blue, bold white, all-caps font, classic close/max/min buttons (pixel art, not SVG or emoji).
	•	Menu bar (optional): “File Edit View Help” in small bitmap font under the title bar.
	•	Main panel: bevelled 3D frames for everything.
	•	Status bar: at the bottom, light grey, with current time, total time, and reaction count in bitmap font.

⸻

5. Waveform:
	•	Blue bars or lines (not smoothed SVGs).
	•	Use a white background inside the waveform panel, not teal or grey.

⸻

6. Buttons:
	•	Square, flat, bevelled (3D), sharp-cornered.
	•	Use classic Win95 play/pause/stop icons—pixel art, not Material Design.

⸻

7. Audio-visual polish (bonus):
	•	Optional: add a 4-LED VU meter using four tiny rectangles, animate when playing.
	•	Change cursor to “pointer” or “resize” (Win95 style) on button/slider hover.

⸻

DEV/REPLIT PROMPT TO COPY–PASTE

Rebuild my audio player UI to precisely match Windows 95 styling.
	•	Use only the classic 16-colour Windows 95 palette.
	•	Font everywhere is bitmap: MS Sans Serif, Chicago, or Press Start 2P. All text must be sharp, no smoothing.
	•	All icons—including reactions—are 16x16 or 20x20 pixel art (not standard emoji or SVG).
	•	All UI elements are rectangular, sharp corners, and have 1px light (top/left) and dark (bottom/right) borders for the 3D effect.
	•	Title bar is blue, with bold white text and pixel-art window controls.
	•	Buttons are grey, 3D, flat, with pixel art icons inside.
	•	Waveform area has a white background and blue bars/lines—no smoothing.
	•	Add a status bar at the bottom, with current time, duration, and reaction count, all in bitmap font.
	•	No drop shadows, no gradients, no rounded corners, no modern UI tricks.
	•	For reference, see this screenshot [attach your previous image].
	•	Do not use Apple/Google/modern emojis—only pixel art.
	•	(Bonus) Add an animated VU meter (4 rectangles) that lights up when music is playing.

Open Source CSS Resources
	•	98.css (by jdan) – Drop-in CSS for classic Win98/95.
	•	XP.css (by botoxparty) – For Windows XP/9x.

You’ll get a closer match to the reference if you build on these CSS frameworks or inspect their button/icon code.

⸻

Bottom line
	•	Your current UI is close. It just needs bitmap fonts, pixel emoji, the Win95 palette, and stricter layout discipline. Kill all anti-aliasing and SVG/modern emoji. Use Win95 iconography for reactions and controls. Swap teal wallpaper for a solid or checker grey desk if you want true authenticity.

If you want a working code sample, I can sketch a React or HTML/CSS snippet for a Win95-style button or panel—just say the word.
